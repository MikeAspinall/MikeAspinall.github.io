## Hello, I'm Mike ðŸ‘‹
**I love data. From my early school days (maths was my favourite subject), through my Masters degree in Chemistry, to my 10+ year career in digital marketing â€“ numbers, data and analytics have always been a big part of my life.**

### My next evolution: Data Science
I'm currently pursuing a BSc in Data Science; a journey that I'm absolutely thrilled to be on. Data science combines my love of data (of course) with my craving for creativity and drive to deliver real-world impact. This portfolio documents the start of my data science journey.

### My key skills

**CRM and database management**
My decade-long career in CRM has covered diverse retail industries; from fashion and homeware, to FMCG and confectionary.

**Analytics**
I have over 10 years of experience in data-centric, analytics-focussed roles, using a variety of tools and skills.

**Data visualisation**
From dashboards to stage presentations, I have strong experience in communicating and visualising data to varied audience types.

**Python**
I'm a confident beginner with Python, and actively learning more every week. This portfolio showcases a few of my recent Python projects.
