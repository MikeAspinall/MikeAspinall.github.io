# Hello, I'm Mike ðŸ‘‹
**I love data. From my early school days (when maths was my favourite subject), through my Masters degree in analytical Chemistry, to my 10+ year career in CRM and digital marketing â€“ numbers, data and analytics have always been a big part of my life.**

## My next evolution: Data Science
I'm currently pursuing a BSc in Data Science; a journey that I'm absolutely thrilled to be on. Data Science combines my love of data (of course) with my craving for creativity and drive to deliver real-life impact through my work. This portfolio is the start of my documentation of this journey.
